# Nafas: Air Quality Analysis

# Background
At [Nafas](https://nafas.co.id/), we are committed to bringing healthy air quality to all people in Indonesia. We are building the first end-to-end air quality ecosystem in the country, combining outdoor and indoor air quality measurements and solutions.

# Dataset
The datasets provided for this analysis include:
- Air quality data
- Meteorological data
- App & User Data
- Device Telemetry
- Health Data

These datasets will aid in answering the case study questions and provide insights into air quality trends in Indonesia.

# Case Study Questions
1. Conduct a full analysis of the datasets and present key trends.
2. Develop a working visualisation dashboard using Tableau.
3. Identify additional datasets needed for a comprehensive analysis of air pollution behavior.
4. Analyze the relationship between outdoor and indoor air pollution.
5. Investigate the relationship between NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> in relation to PM2.5.
6. Choose one sensor from the 20 stations and conduct a full analysis of its location, performance compared to the city and other sensors, factors impacting air pollution behavior in the area, and assumptions about the key pollution sources in the area.
7. Design a user segmentation analysis of the Nafas App, including a map of how to organize it, and identify the most important events.
8. Identify additional insights from the dataset.
